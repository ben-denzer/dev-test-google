The API server isn't working and I wanted to make a project that is functional, so I used the Google Places API. The pictures that they send back are just placeholders basically but this app has the exact same functionality as the original dev-test. 

You won't be able to run it locally because of the API restrictions, but I have it live at [https://bdenzer.xyz](https://bdenzer.xyz).
